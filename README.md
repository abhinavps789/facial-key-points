# facial-key-points

Model that helps in finding out the facial key points. Data taken from a Kaggle competition. Since this was my first CV project, this was coded by referring to other submissions.  

The essence of this code lies in the data augmentation techniques it uses to diversify the dataset it has to better fit unseen data. It does multiple data augmentation methods including shifts, rotation, adding
noise, etc. It uses a Sequential Convolution model to fit the data.

**To my futureself**  
This project gave me a very good idea of CV. Though before this I hadn't learned much about CV, through this project I was able to understand what goes on in CV. Still a lot of ground to cover.
